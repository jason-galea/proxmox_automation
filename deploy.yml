# Check/Build base container template
# Primary benefit is preinstalled packages
# - import_playbook: "deploy/template.yml"

### TODO:
# - Convert this section to roles, to deploy pihole before the other hosts
# - Change "ansible_host" in inv.yml to DNS names
# - use "vars" to configure pihole with "ansible_host" = IP instead, as it is the first host
### E.g:
# - name: "Deploy Pihole"
#   hosts: pihole
#   roles:
#   - create
#   - start
#   - prepare
#   - deploy # This needs to direct each host to their own playbook

# Create pihole
- import_playbook: "deploy/create.yml"
# - import_playbook: "deploy/clone_template.yml"
# Start pihole
- import_playbook: "deploy/start.yml"
# Prepare pihole
- import_playbook: "deploy/prepare.yml"
# Deploy Pihole
- import_playbook: "deploy/services/pihole.yml"

# Add A records to Pihole


# Deploy other services using DNS names (The default "ansible_host" value in inv.yml)
# - import_playbook: "deploy/services/emby.yml"
# - import_playbook: "deploy/services/wekan.yml"
# - import_playbook: "deploy/services/pihole.yml"
